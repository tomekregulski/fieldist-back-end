# Intelly - General Overview and Current State

The Fieldist repos are part of a larger project called Intelly, which is a platform being built to help small-to-medium-sized food and beverage brands manage various aspects of their business. The project is divided into separate repos to allow indeoendent development. Below, you can find a list of the specific fton and back ends that make up this project, links to their individual repos, as well as whether or not they have been deployed for public demo.

The public demos should be accessed thought this link: https://gallant-wing-415919.netlify.app/
This will bring you to a login page, which you can enter with the following credentials:

email: guest@intelly.test
password: guest

Once logged in, you will be brough to a dashboard that allows you to navigate the project in its current form. The guest account will have access to all services currently deployed for public demo, with only certain subservices being excluded to prevent any possible interference with sensitive data.

# This Specific Repo - Overview

As mentioned above, Intelly is split into several independent repos in order to facilitate different timelines for development, and thus make it possible to demonstrate those services that have reached an appropriate stage of devlopment.

The repo you are currently visiting is the back end for the Field Events application. It provides the necessary routes and database connections needed for the rep and admin front ends to function.

# Additional Goals for Development

The further development of this project will be guided by the development of the related front ends, as well as continuous revision toward efficiency and performance optimization.

# Installation and Contribution

If you wish to test this project locally, you may clone the repo to a directory on your machine. Navigate to the new directory using your terminal, and install all necessary dependencies by running the command 'npm i'.

The app itself should be set up to connect to the deployed server, so at that point, you should be able to start it up by running the command 'npm start' and accessing its routes via localhost:4500 or a service such as Postman.

At this time, I am not inviting individual contribution, unless there has been a specific conversation around it. If you come across something in the code that you wish to share, by all means message me and we can speak about it.
